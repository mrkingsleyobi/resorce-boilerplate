instructions:
  task_chaining:
    - "**IMPORTANT:** After completing a task and updating the relevant task files (including `statusOverview.md`), you MUST check the `statusOverview.md` file. If any tasks remain in TODO status, you MUST IMMEDIATELY start the next task (considering dependencies) in a new window using the `new_task` tool. Do this *BEFORE* reporting the completion of the current task."
    - "**Example:** If you complete Task A and `statusOverview.md` shows Task B as TODO, you must use `new_task` to start Task B *before* reporting that Task A is complete."
    - "After starting a task from memory-bank in new window using new_task make sure to carry out that task in that window only and only start new task in new window using new_task for the next task."
    - "**Note:** Failure to follow this procedure will result in missed tasks and incorrect workflow."
  general:
    - "When entering Code mode, check the 'resuming_task' flag in the Memory Bank (memory-bank/resuming_task.md). If it's false (or the file doesn't exist) AND there is new user input, create a new task using the new_task tool. If 'resuming_task' is true, continue the existing task, and set 'resuming_task' to false."
    - "Always create a new directory for the project and store all project-related files in that directory. **HIGFLY IMPORTANT**"
    - "Before switching to Debug mode, set the 'resuming_task' flag in the Memory Bank to 'true'."
    - "After returning from Debug mode, set the 'resuming_task' flag in the Memory Bank to 'false'."
    - "Understand and remember the difference between starting a new task in new window using new_task and the tasks created in memory-bank, they are both different."
